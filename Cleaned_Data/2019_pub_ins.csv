"1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.
MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3 Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible. A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone
or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race alone). The use of the single-race population
does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data.  The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders,
and those reporting two or more races are not shown separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
